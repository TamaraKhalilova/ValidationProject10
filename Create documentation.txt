ANSWER:
### Application Documentation

#### Application Description:

The application is a simple React-based user interface designed to validate input strings against specific criteria. Users can input a string into a provided text field, and the application will dynamically validate the string based on a combination of requirements including length, character variety, and the absence of whitespace. The validation results are displayed immediately, offering a responsive experience for the user.

#### Regex Implementation Description:

The core of the validation mechanism is a complex regular expression, which is designed to ensure the input string meets multiple criteria simultaneously. Specifically, this regular expression checks that the string contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list, while ensuring there are no whitespace characters present. Moreover, the string length is dynamically validated to ensure it does not exceed a specified maximum length. Using positive lookaheads, the regular expression can efficiently check for the presence of each criterion without consuming any characters, enabling it to validate the entire string in one operation.

#### How to Run the Developed Application Locally:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Navigate to the root directory of the application using your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
4. After the installation is complete, run `npm start`. This will start the development server and the application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to access the application.

#### How to Run the Test Function Locally:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the application using your terminal or command prompt.
2. Open the file containing the `testRegex` function.
3. At the bottom of this file, invoke the `testRegex` function with your desired maximum length. For example: `testRegex(20);`.
4. Run `node <filename>.js` where `<filename>` is the name of the file containing the test function. This will execute the function and the results will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt. Any failures will be clearly indicated. 

(Note: The above step assumes that the test function and the regex implementation are in a standalone `.js` file. If they are integrated within the React app, you would likely call the test function from within a component or event handler and display or log results accordingly.)

QUESTION: please provide the same answer but with the formatting for .md file. i mean with symbols(tags) that add styles to the text

ANSWER: Certainly! Here's the documentation formatted with Markdown styling for a .md (Markdown) file:
 (...here is the same text as above..)

QUESTION: GPT interface provides the result of the formatting. how to copy the raw text with the symbols(tags) for .md file?

ANSWER: 
I understand what you're looking for now. When using markdown in the GPT interface, it renders the markdown, making it difficult to see the raw text.

To help you out, I'll represent special Markdown characters with their HTML entity codes, so you can see and copy them as raw text:

You can replace the HTML entity codes (`&#35;` for `#`, `&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`) with their corresponding characters in your `.md` file for proper markdown rendering.
